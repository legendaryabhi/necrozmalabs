        The world is changing faster than ever. With every passing day,
        engineers, scientists, and visionaries push the boundaries of whatâ€™s
        possible. But for those who dream of building the future, one challenge
        remains: <strong>access</strong>. Access to cutting-edge tools,
        knowledge, and a community that thrives on collaboration.
      </p>

      <p className="text-lg text-gray-300 mb-6">
